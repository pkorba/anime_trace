## Usage

Do one of the following:  
1. Reply to a message containing a screenshot/video or an external link to a screenshot/video with a command `[p]trace`.  
2. Send a single message that contains a screenshot/video as an attachment and a command `[p]trace`.  
3. Send a single message that contains a link to the screenshot/video and a command `[p]trace link`.

If your message contains both an image and a link, then the attachment will be used.  
In order to check the search quota and limit send a message with a command: `[p]trace quota`.

## Configuration

You can configure the plugin in maubot's control panel.
* `preview_size` - controls the size of video preview and its thumbnail. Available options are:
  * `l` - large
  * `m` - medium (default)
  * `s` - small
* `api_key` - if you have your own trace.moe API key, you can put it here
* `mute` - controls whether the video previews have sound. Available options are `yes` and `no` (default)
* `cut_borders` - trace.moe can detect black borders automatically and cut away unnecessary parts of the images that would affect search results accuracy. This is useful if your image is a screencap from a smartphone or iPad that contains black bars. Available options are `yes` (default) and `no`.
* `max_results` - controls the number of displayed results (defaults to 5)

## Notes

- Plugin supports images and videos - according to trace.moe docs, any format that is supported by ffmpeg
